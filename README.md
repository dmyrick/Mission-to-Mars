# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to web scrape data from different websites concerning Mars. The tools used were Python, Flask, MongoDB, Web-Driver Manager, BeautifulSoup, and Splinter. The web application will be updated automatically when the data extracted is scraped. The following was extracted:
  1. Current title and corresponding summary from the NASA news webpage.

  4. Images of Mars's hemispheres from the Mars Hemispheres webpage. Once the scraped data listed above and images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and titles were stored on a Mongo database, a web application was used to display the data. Additionally, CSS Bootstrap was used to update the button's background to green and add the hemisphere images as thumbnails.
